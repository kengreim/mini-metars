# Mini METARs
Mini METARs is a micro-utility to display up-to-date METAR information (primarily altimeter and wind direction + speed, with full METAR toggle-able) for a number of user-inputted airports/stations in a minimal on-top window.

Built with Tauri, with a Rust backend for METAR fetching and a SolidJS frontend for UI actions.
